React Hue is a color palette tool built in a combination of Meteor.js, React, Material UI, Bootstrap. This simple web app mainly to contribute to seek what are better colors for web, mobile, UI development, the popular color set used by industry companies, color toolboxes, and some information for color blindness.

## Why use Meteor?
Meteor is a real-time, easy-use full-stack web platform with data synchronization client/server (DDP). It is on the top of Node.js and MongoDB, which means one language can be used in both front-end client and back-end server. It saves a lot of my time and it keeps its promise of optimizing for developer happiness.

## Why use React?
React is fast rendered, and enforces a lot of rules and guidelines that make it clearer what the “right” way to do any given task is. While it’s not as tightly integrated with Meteor (yet), it does have a much larger overall ecosystem.

## Why use Material UI?
As a superstar project host by Goolge, Material UI is more clear, attractive, delightful, when it is compared with other popular UI frameworks. Meanwhile, it leverages good sides of React.js, and improves the rendering effects. After using frameworks like Bootstrap for a long time, it is a good time for us to try new tastes.
